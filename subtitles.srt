4
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:01,520
it

5
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:01,900
down.

6
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,160
You’re

7
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,420

8
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:03,580

11
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:04,440
what

12
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:04,740

13
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,060
you

14
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,200
the

19
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,220

20
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,000
NPCs,

21
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,400
right?

22
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:08,740
First

23
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,180
off,

24
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:09,940
forget

25
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,220
the

26
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:10,580

good

30
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,260
communicator”

31
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,640
spiel.

32
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,140
That’s

33
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:14,400
so

34
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,180
2010.

35
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:16,700
You

36
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:16,920
gotta

37
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,120
You

38
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,360

42
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:18,760
show

43
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,020
how

44
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,400
you’re

45
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:19,660
built

46
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,120
different.

47
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,460
Like,

48
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,080
if

49
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,420
you’re

50
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:22,580

organizing

54
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,300
chaos,

55
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,180
don’t

56
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,460
just

57
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:25,900
say

58
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,140
it—hit

59
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:26,480
it—hit

60
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:26,720
‘em

61
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:26,940

a

63
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:27,380
story

64
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:27,740
about

66
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,300
you

67
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:28,580
pulled

68
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,020

event

73
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,560
that

74
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:30,840
had

75
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,400
everyone

76
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,860
saying,

77
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:32,680
“Only

Ohio.”

80
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:34,860
That’s

81
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,060
how

82
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,260
you

83
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:35,520
leave

84
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:35,920
an

85
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,460
impression.

86
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:37,780
Now,

87
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,520
let’s

88
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:38,680
talk

89
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,060

90
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,440
You’re

91
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:40,640
not

92
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,120
just

93
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,420
“good

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,140
teamwork.”

96
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:43,500
Nah,

97
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,020
you’re

98
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,160
the

99
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,480
Duke

100
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:44,760
Dennis

101
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,140
of

102
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,720
collaboration,

103
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,560
the

104
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:46,800
one

105
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,040
who

106
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,340
keeps

107
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:47,600
the

108
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:47,880
vibes

109
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,240
high

110
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,680
and

111
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:48,860
the

112
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,100
drama

113
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,420
low.

114
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:50,640
Maybe

115
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,100
you’re

116
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,280
the

117
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,580

Gronk

119
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,220
of

120
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,500
your

121
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:52,860
group,

122
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,640
always

123
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,140
stepping

124
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,420
up

125
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:54,740
when

126
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:54,920
the

127
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,440
pressure’s

128
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:55,660
on.

129
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:56,840
Or

130
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,260
maybe

131
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,640
you’re

132
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:57,820
the

imposter

135
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,400
who’s

136
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,860

137
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,380
carrying

138
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:00,700
the

139
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:00,920
whole

140
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,320
squad.

141
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,680
Whatever

142
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,100
it

143
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,380
is,

own

145
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:03,960
it.

146
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,080
And

147
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,440
don’t

148
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:05,840
forget

149
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,100

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:10,640
handle

162
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:10,900
the

163
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,160

167
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,300
needed.

168
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,700
Education?

169
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,200
Sure,

party?

199
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,000
That’s

200
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,140
the

201
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,380
