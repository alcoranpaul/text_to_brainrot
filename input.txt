# Setting Yourself Apart

How many people are in your class with you? As you've all been completing the same education in your field of study, it is time to think about what makes you, YOU! One term that is commonly used in career coaching is _unique selling proposition (USP)_, which is a short list of key attributes that set you apart from the rest of the candidates.

Imagine that you've been reading a job posting and one of the skills the organization is looking for is "Good communication skills". What does that even mean, anyway? If you write or say, "I have good communication skills" on your resume or cover letter or in an interview, you run the risk of sounding just like everyone else. You need to find a way to set yourself apart. The best way to do that is to connect your skill to some concrete, identifiable, example that the potential employer will notice and remember. This example could be about where you developed your communication skills, or how you have applied them in the past.

## Who am I? How am I different?

So, before you do ANYTHING else, it's time to think about what you, specifically, offer. What makes you awesome?! Let's break it down into manageable chunks...

### Experiences

Think about some experiences you have that bring value to any organization. This doesn't have to be job experience. Volunteering, creating something, being on a committee, etc., are all experiences that lead you to skills and abilities and learning opportunities. Don't just think about what you did, think about how you did it, why it matters, and what you learned.

### Skills

What are some things that you do well? This one can be hard for some of us to sort out, so ask someone who knows you well. You can start by asking them, **"If we were going to do a project together, what task would you give me and why?"** If the person answers, "I'd make you the note taker because you always take good, clear notes", consider that you might be a skilled planner and/or organizer, especially when it comes to communication. 

### Education

You likely have both formal and informal education. Formally, you'll graduate from RRC Polytech, but what about that photography class you took two years ago? That might not go under the "Education" component of your resume, but it might be something you mention in a cover letter when you are providing evidence of your creativity or technical savvy.

### Your You-ness

Is there anything else about you that is particular and interesting? Lived in another country for a while and learned a language? Make videos on loom-knitting for YouTube? Have an interest in personal finance? These things won't necessarily form part of your job ready communication, but they might help you to figure out your interests, values, and goals.
